        <h1> THE BEGINNING OF MY TECH JOURNEY</h1>
        <h2>MOTIVATION</h2>
        <p>Today, 28/12/2025, I have decided to lock in and begin my tech journey. I have decided to transition into Backend mostly because I am tired
            of not having a tangible skill that would fetch me money from the comfprt of my home. I also no longer want to work 9-5 and would like to stop wasting my time in transit. 
            The most important reason is because <strong>I need money</strong>. After the oil and gas sector, tech is the second most lucrative career.
            I mean in Nigerian parlance, <em>tech is the new oil</em>.
